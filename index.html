    <p id= "bio"><strong>Bio:</strong> I grew up in California and attended UC Santa Barbara to study my passion for human beings, social and biological. However, I have found a proclivity toward working with technology. I was the kid always daydreaming in class about the subject matter at hand. Kind of a nerd. But nerdy is okay; no pejorative here!!!  Currently, I am in the middle of a career change to adapt myself to the newcoming age of postmodern supercomputing and artificial intelligence. I like to say we should only be as wary as Magellan on this new journey. Contact me for beginner software work or to just discuss new changes in technology. An open mind, with our tools of logic, is unstoppable.</p>
    
    <p id="mission"><strong>Mission:</strong> I am aspiring to become a back end developer and to further my tech education in Machine Learning and Artficial Intelligence. I don't think tech development, and my burgeoning forway into web development, are quick rich quick schemes. I want to invent. I want to be part of projects that invent and make a difference. I will see where my education takes me in these uncertain times but my bottom line is that if you have a dream, a mind, and you think you may have somwewhever you can fit me. I want to find that somewhere I belong. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Interests:</strong> My biggest interest is hearing YOUR story, and making both our lives more interesting.</p>
